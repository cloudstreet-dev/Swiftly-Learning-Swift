# Chapter 1: Swift's Origin Story and Setup

Welcome, fellow code warrior! You've survived JavaScript's callback hell, wrestled with Java's verbose ceremonies, or perhaps endured C's memory management nightmares. Now you're here, ready to learn Swift—Apple's answer to "what if we made a language that developers actually enjoy using?"

## A Brief History (Or: How Apple Decided Objective-C Needed a Retirement Plan)

Swift emerged in 2014 when Chris Lattner, after presumably one too many nights debugging Objective-C's square bracket syntax, decided enough was enough. The language was designed with ambitious goals: be as fast as C++, as expressive as Ruby, and as safe as... well, safer than anything you're probably used to.

Unlike Objective-C, which looks like someone tried to crossbreed Smalltalk with C after a few drinks, Swift embraces modern language design. It's strongly typed (but with type inference that actually works), compiled (but with a REPL for when you're feeling interactive), and manages to be both powerful and approachable.

## Setting Up Your Swift Environment

### On macOS (The Promised Land)

If you're on a Mac, congratulations—you're living Swift's best life. Here's your setup:

1. **Install Xcode** from the Mac App Store. Yes, it's a 10GB download. Yes, it's worth it. Go make coffee.

2. **Command Line Tools**: Once Xcode is installed, open Terminal and run:
   ```bash
   xcode-select --install
   ```

3. **Verify Installation**:
   ```bash
   swift --version
   ```

You can now use Swift in three ways:
- **Swift REPL**: Just type `swift` in Terminal
- **Swift Playgrounds**: Xcode's interactive notebooks (File → New → Playground)
- **Full Projects**: Create an app, command-line tool, or framework

### On Linux (The Rebel Alliance)

Swift on Linux? Absolutely! Apple open-sourced Swift, and it runs beautifully on Ubuntu, CentOS, and others.

1. **Download Swift**: Head to [swift.org](https://swift.org/download/) and grab the appropriate tarball

2. **Install Dependencies** (Ubuntu example):
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install clang libicu-dev
   ```

3. **Extract and Add to PATH**:
   ```bash
   tar xzf swift-<VERSION>-<PLATFORM>.tar.gz
   export PATH=/path/to/swift/usr/bin:"${PATH}"
   ```

### On Windows (The Plot Twist)

Yes, Swift runs on Windows now! The future is wild.

1. Download the Windows installer from [swift.org](https://swift.org/download/)
2. Run the installer (requires Windows 10 or later)
3. Open Command Prompt or PowerShell and verify with `swift --version`

## Your First Swift Program (It's Not "Hello, World"... Just Kidding, It Is)

Let's write our first Swift program. Create a file called `hello.swift`:

```swift
print("Hello, Swift!")

// But let's make it more interesting
let languages = ["JavaScript", "Java", "Python", "Ruby", "C++"]
let randomLanguage = languages.randomElement()!

print("Goodbye, \(randomLanguage). Hello, Swift!")
```

Run it with:
```bash
swift hello.swift
```

Notice a few things already:
- No semicolons (your pinky finger can finally rest)
- String interpolation with `\()` (because concatenation is so 2010)
- The `!` force-unwraps the optional (we'll explain this mind-bender in Chapter 3)
- No main function required for scripts

## The Swift REPL: Your New Best Friend

Fire up the REPL by typing `swift` in your terminal. This is where you'll experiment, test ideas, and generally fool around:

```swift
$ swift
Welcome to Swift!

1> let greeting = "Hello"
2> let target = "Swift learner"
3> print("\(greeting), \(target)!")
Hello, Swift learner!

4> 42 * 13
$R0: Int = 546

5> ["Swift", "is", "fun"].joined(separator: " ")
$R1: String = "Swift is fun"
```

Pro tip: In the REPL, type `:help` for commands, or `:quit` when you need to return to the real world.

## Swift Package Manager: No More Dependency Hell

Coming from npm, Maven, or pip? You'll love Swift Package Manager (SPM). It's built into Swift and just works.

Create a new package:
```bash
mkdir MyAwesomeProject
cd MyAwesomeProject
swift package init --type executable
```

This creates:
```
MyAwesomeProject/
├── Package.swift
├── Sources/
│   └── MyAwesomeProject/
│       └── main.swift
└── Tests/
    └── MyAwesomeProjectTests/
        └── MyAwesomeProjectTests.swift
```

Build and run:
```bash
swift build
swift run
```

Add dependencies by editing `Package.swift`:
```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/apple/swift-argument-parser", from: "1.0.0"),
]
```

Then `swift build` fetches everything. No `node_modules` folder with the mass of a small star. No classpath nightmares. It just works.

## IDEs and Editors: Choose Your Weapon

### Xcode (macOS only)
The full Apple experience. Fantastic for iOS/macOS development, excellent debugging, occasionally crashes just to keep you humble.

### VS Code
Install the "Swift" extension by the Swift Server Work Group. Great for cross-platform development:
```bash
code --install-extension sswg.swift-lang
```

### AppCode (JetBrains)
If you're coming from IntelliJ IDEA, you'll feel at home here. Paid, but powerful.

### Vim/Neovim/Emacs
You know who you are. SourceKit-LSP has your back.

## The Swift Philosophy: A Preview

Before we dive deeper in upcoming chapters, here's what makes Swift special:

1. **Safety First**: Swift makes it hard to shoot yourself in the foot (but doesn't make the gun impossible to find when you really need it)

2. **Expressiveness**: Write less code that does more, without sacrificing clarity

3. **Performance**: Compiled to native code, optimized to within an inch of its life

4. **Modern**: Embraces current best practices—protocol-oriented programming, functional concepts, async/await

5. **Pragmatic**: Designed by people who actually ship apps, not language theorists in ivory towers

## What's Next?

You've got Swift running, you've written your first program, and you're ready to dive deeper. In Chapter 2, we'll explore Swift's type system—a beautiful balance between "the compiler has your back" and "I'm not writing Java, thanks."

Get ready to discover why Swift developers often say they can't go back to other languages. It's not Stockholm syndrome, we promise. Well, mostly not.

## Quick Exercises

1. **REPL Exploration**: Open the Swift REPL and try these:
   - Create an array of your favorite programming languages
   - Use `map` to uppercase them all
   - Filter only the ones that start with "S"

2. **Package Creation**: Create a Swift package that prints a random programming joke. Bonus points if it's actually funny.

3. **Script Writing**: Write a Swift script that lists all files in the current directory and their sizes. Hint: `import Foundation` gives you `FileManager`.

Remember: Swift is a journey, not a destination. Although if it were a destination, it would probably be type-safe, performant, and have really nice syntax for closures.

Ready? Let's Swift!
